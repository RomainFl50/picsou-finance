# ADR: Override Spring Authorization Server's public-client refresh-token defaults

> Date: 2026-07-22
> Status: ✅ Active

## Context

The iOS app's OAuth2 client (`picsou-ios`, decided in
[2026-07-03-oauth2-authorization-server-for-native-app.md](./2026-07-03-oauth2-authorization-server-for-native-app.md))
is a **public client**: no client secret, PKCE-only, `ClientAuthenticationMethod.NONE` — the correct
model for a native app that cannot hold a confidential secret. That ADR's own trade-offs section
already anticipated refresh tokens working ("refreshed access tokens carry the stale `tv`…").

Live end-to-end testing (`ios-app/PicsouTests/E2E/LiveBackendE2ETests.swift`, run against a real
backend instead of `MockURLProtocol`) found that the refresh flow never actually worked: the token
response from the authorization_code exchange had **no `refresh_token` field at all**. Decompiling
`spring-security-oauth2-authorization-server` 1.4.5 pinned two independent, silent framework defaults
as the cause:

1. `OAuth2RefreshTokenGenerator.generate()` calls a private `isPublicClientForAuthorizationCodeGrant`
   check and returns `null` — no log, no error — whenever the requesting client's
   `ClientAuthenticationMethod` is `NONE`. This holds regardless of the client's own
   `authorization_grant_types` (which correctly listed `refresh_token`) or its
   `TokenSettings.refreshTokenTimeToLive`.
2. Even with a refresh token minted some other way, `PublicClientAuthenticationConverter` — the only
   built-in converter that can authenticate a `NONE`-method client at all — only activates for a
   PKCE-shaped request (`OAuth2EndpointUtils.matchesPkceTokenRequest`, which requires a
   `code_verifier` parameter). A `grant_type=refresh_token` request never has one (PKCE is an
   authorization_code-grant mechanism), so a public client's redemption request falls through
   unauthenticated and the AS's `exceptionHandling` entry point 302s it to `/login`.

Net effect in production: every device was force-logged-out on the access-token TTL (15 minutes)
with the app's own `TokenRefresher` (built assuming refresh would work — see the 2026-07-03 ADR)
never getting a token to use.

## Decision

Add two small, targeted overrides in `AuthorizationServerConfig`, both scoped to exactly the gap
above and nothing else:

1. **`tokenGenerator()`** — a `@Bean` supplying a `DelegatingOAuth2TokenGenerator` built from the
   framework's own `JwtGenerator` (with the existing `jwtTokenCustomizer()`) and
   `OAuth2AccessTokenGenerator`, plus a private `NativeAppRefreshTokenGenerator` that reimplements
   `OAuth2RefreshTokenGenerator`'s real generation logic (96-byte URL-safe base64 key via
   `Base64StringKeyGenerator`, TTL from `RegisteredClient.getTokenSettings()`) **minus** the
   public-client bypass.
2. **`PublicClientRefreshTokenAuthenticationConverter` + `...Provider`** — registered via
   `.clientAuthentication(c -> c.authenticationConverter(...).authenticationProvider(...))`, which
   `OAuth2ClientAuthenticationConfigurer.init()` **prepends** ahead of the framework's own
   converters/providers (`authenticationProviders.addAll(0, custom)`, confirmed by decompiling that
   class too). The converter recognizes a `grant_type=refresh_token` POST carrying a bare `client_id`
   (and no `Authorization` header, so it never shadows a future confidential client); the provider
   authenticates by `client_id` alone after checking the registered client exists, allows `NONE`
   auth, and has the `refresh_token` grant type — the same checks
   `PublicClientAuthenticationProvider` makes, minus the PKCE verification that only applies to an
   authorization_code exchange.

Both defer (return `null`) for any request shape they don't recognize, so the authorization_code+PKCE
path — and any future confidential client — is untouched.

## Alternatives considered

### Give `picsou-ios` a client secret

- **Pros**: `ClientAuthenticationMethod.CLIENT_SECRET_BASIC`/`_POST` clients get the framework's
  refresh-token generation and authentication for free — no overrides needed.
- **Cons**: defeats the entire point of the original ADR's client model. A secret embedded in a
  distributed native binary isn't confidential — this would be security theater, not a real
  authentication factor, and would misrepresent the client's actual trust level to anyone reading
  the config later.

### Hand-roll a bearer-refresh endpoint outside the Authorization Server

- **Pros**: full control; no need to reverse-engineer Spring AS internals.
- **Cons**: re-fragments the token model the 2026-07-03 ADR deliberately unified (one AS, one token
  issuer, one validation path). Would need its own persistence, rotation, and revocation logic —
  reimplementing exactly what `JdbcOAuth2AuthorizationService` already does correctly for the
  authorization_code leg.

### Accept 15-minute sessions; rely on silent re-authorization instead of refresh

- **Pros**: zero new code.
- **Cons**: not actually silent — `ASWebAuthenticationSession` doesn't run headlessly, so a session
  drop was a real (if brief) UI interruption, not the "device re-authenticates silently" experience
  the original ADR promised for a backend *restart*; happening every 15 minutes during normal use is
  a different order of problem, not a corner case worth shipping.

## Reasoning

Spring Authorization Server's defaults here are a defensible security posture for **browser-based**
public clients (a JS-readable refresh token is a bigger prize than a short-lived access token) but
overly broad for a native app whose refresh token lives in the Keychain, never touches JS-accessible
storage, and is already rotated on every use. RFC 6749's public-client model treats the client's own
`client_id` as non-secret by design — the *token itself* (high-entropy, single-use via
`reuseRefreshTokens(false)`) is the real credential, which is exactly what the custom provider checks
for. This isn't a security downgrade relative to what the 2026-07-03 ADR already committed to; it's
making that commitment actually functional.

## Trade-offs accepted

- **Two more classes to reason about in the AS filter chain**, both undocumented-by-the-framework
  workarounds tied to a specific Spring Authorization Server version's internal behavior (verified
  against 1.4.5 by decompiling — a version bump should re-verify both `OAuth2RefreshTokenGenerator`
  and `PublicClientAuthenticationConverter` haven't changed shape).
- **Provider order is load-bearing.** The fix relies on `OAuth2ClientAuthenticationConfigurer`
  prepending custom providers ahead of the framework defaults, so the custom refresh-grant provider
  is tried (and returns a real result) before `PublicClientAuthenticationProvider` gets a chance to
  throw `invalid_grant` on the missing PKCE verifier. This is framework behavior, not something this
  codebase controls — a future Spring AS upgrade that changes provider ordering would need this
  re-verified (the regression test would fail loudly, not silently).

## Consequences

- **Edited**: `backend/src/main/java/com/picsou/config/AuthorizationServerConfig.java` — added
  `tokenGenerator()`, `NativeAppRefreshTokenGenerator`, `PublicClientRefreshTokenAuthenticationConverter`,
  `PublicClientRefreshTokenAuthenticationProvider`; `authorizationServerSecurityFilterChain` now takes
  a `RegisteredClientRepository` param and wires `.clientAuthentication(...)`.
- **New test**: `backend/src/test/java/com/picsou/config/PublicClientRefreshTokenIntegrationTest.java`
  — real filter chain, real Postgres (Testcontainers): authorize → exchange (refresh_token present) →
  redeem (200, rotated tokens) → rotated access token works against `/api/dashboard` → the
  rotated-away refresh token is rejected (`invalid_grant`). Self-skips without Docker.
- **No schema change**, no client-facing API shape change beyond the token response now correctly
  including `refresh_token`.
- Full context and the two-bug narrative: [`docs/features/ios-app.md`](../features/ios-app.md)
  (Authentication section).

## Supersedes

None. Amends [2026-07-03-oauth2-authorization-server-for-native-app.md](./2026-07-03-oauth2-authorization-server-for-native-app.md)
— that ADR's public-client + PKCE decision is unchanged; this is a correction to its implementation
(the refresh grant it assumed would work).
